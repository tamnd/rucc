//! What an attribute means to a layout.
//!
//! Design: `spec/13-gnu-compat.md` section 13.4 and `spec/12-abi-and-runtime.md` section 12.6.
//!
//! Two attributes change the size and the offsets of a record, and getting either of them wrong
//! is a miscompile rather than a missed optimization: a program that lays a structure over a
//! wire format or a hardware register is written against the layout the attribute asks for and
//! reads the wrong bytes without it. Those two are read here.
//!
//! `packed` takes the padding out. On a record it applies to every member, and on a member it
//! applies to that member alone, which is a difference the layout engine already holds.
//!
//! `aligned(n)` raises an alignment and never lowers it, which is the rule for the attribute on
//! its own. Written beside `packed` it is the way a program says both at once, as in
//! `__attribute__((packed, aligned(4)))`, and there the record is packed and then aligned to
//! four, which is not the same as either of them alone.
//!
//! `scalar_storage_order` is the third of that family and is the one that is refused. It reverses
//! the byte order of every scalar in the record, so a compiler that reads past it lays the record
//! out in the host's order and hands back every field with its bytes the wrong way round. There
//! is no harmless reading of it and no partial one, which is why it is an error here rather than
//! a warning: a program that does not build is a compiler that told the truth.
//!
//! `vector_size(n)` is the fourth one read here and is the one that builds a type rather than
//! changing a layout. It says the declared type is `n` bytes of the type that was written, taken
//! as lanes, so `int __attribute__((vector_size(16)))` is four `int` in a row that every operator
//! works on at once. A compiler that reads past it declares the lane type instead and quietly
//! computes on one lane where the program asked for all of them, which is why it is here.
//!
//! Everything else in an attribute list is left where it is. An attribute nothing implements is
//! not this module's to complain about, since the same list is written on declarations that
//! have no layout at all.
