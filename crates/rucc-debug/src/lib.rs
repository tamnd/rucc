//! DWARF 5 generation.
//!
//! Design: `spec/11-asm-objects-debug.md`. Layer rank 9, see `spec/18-package-layout.md`.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Not implemented. This crate exists from the first commit so that the layer rank it holds
//! is real and `cargo xtask layers` has something to check. The work lands in M8.
//!
//! Every crate in the workspace is published, and publishing implies a promise. This one is
//! tier 3: its Rust API is explicitly unstable and will change without a major version bump.
//! Depend on the `rucc` binary's behaviour, not on this.
